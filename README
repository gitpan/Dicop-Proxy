=head1 README

You can use perldoc to read this document: C<perldoc README>.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Prior to running the server/client you must install it. This document gives you
a very broad overview of the neccessary steps, for detailed instructions refer
please to the L<INSTALL> file (f.i. via perldoc INSTALL).

=head2 Verify the package

Before you do anything with the downloaded package, verify the signature.

Download our GnuPG key from http://www.bsi.bund.de/produkte/dicop/download.htm
and then check the detachd signature with:

	gpg --verify Dicop-Proxy-3.00_11.tar.gz.asc

(replace 3.00_11 with the actual version you got)

If the signature does not verify ok, please notify us immidiately. B<DO NOT>
run perl Makefile.PL or anythign else nor install the package when the
signature cannot be verified ok. B<Your system might get compromised!>.

=head2 Requirements

You will need Perl v5.8.3 or better, preferable Perl v5.8.6, to run the proxy.

You also need an HTTP or FTP server to serve the clients with files. The proxy
will answer file requests from the clients with the URL of the file server.

This can either be the same file server that the main server refers to, or
a different one. But it absolutely needs to enable the client to download
the same requested files.

=item proxy

When the proxy-daemon is running, you can connect to it via a web browser by
using http://127.0.0.1:8889/ (the default port) and it should return the main
page.

=back

If the proxy is running at another machine, simple connect to it
like you would connect to any other web browser, by using the correct IP and
port.

You can use the perl documentation utility perldoc to get more information. The
documentation is located in the subdirectory C<doc/>.


=head2 Hardware

The maschine to run the proxy should have at least 32 MB (no X-Windows) or
64 MB (with X-Windows) so that no swapping occurs. A 200 Mhz x86 CPU does just
fine for a couple hundred clients, although having one or more Ghz and a
GigaByte or two RAM never hurt ;)


=head2 Supported platforms

The proxy was successfully under the following platforms:

Linux SuSE 9.1
--------------
 Perl v5.8.5		test-environment

Linux SuSE 7.3
--------------
 Perl v5.8.3		development

It should work on Unix/Linux platforms, and even on Mac-OS. However, we can not
guaranty that it will work. If you experience any problems, please contact us
(see below).
