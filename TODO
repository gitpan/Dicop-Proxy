=head2 Misc.

=over 2

=item *

The server greets the proxy, but not the client. Make it send
over a greeting to the client, so that the proxy can relay this greeting
to the client instead of saying "Helo unknown". (Or replace server greeting
with proxy greetin the client?)

=item *

Better logging and error checking need to be implemented.

=item *

Add a client_min_id and client_max_id setting to the config file and the
only allow clients in that range to connect.

=back

=head2 Proxy chaining

The proxy cannot yet handle connections from other proxies - it needs to
rewrite the incoming requests for the server differently than when a client
connects.
